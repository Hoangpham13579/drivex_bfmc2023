1. Training the model
python3 model_train.py --dataset_name *dataset's folder name* --folder_name *model's folder name*

2. Perform the driving with ML
roslaunch drivex_main map_with_cardrivex.launch
roslaunch drivex_main main_driving.launch model_name:=*model's folder name*
(Debug)
rm -rf ~/.gazebo/models/* && roslaunch drivex_main map_with_cardrivex.launch

- Collect dataset
roslaunch drivex_driving dataset_writing.launch

3. Some useful commands
  - View camera from the car robot
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/top_front_camera/rgb/image_raw

Current bug
- ML model already published data to topic /model_steering based on the camera input. BUT it looks like the car doesn't use data from topic /model_steering, maybe another topic instead?  --> Fix DONE!!!
